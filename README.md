# Configurable ECU Emulator for Creating Digital Twins in the Car Manufacturing Industry

Modern consumer vehicles are packed with electronic systems. These electronics include data
gathering using different kinds of sensors, processing them, and making decisions according
to the data to make the driving experience safe, easy and pleasant. These electronic systems
are controlled by embedded systems called Electronic Control Units(ECUs). placed inside
the vehicle. There could easily be over 20 ECUs in a vehicle and their control software is
rapidly evolving. These ECUs may range from fuel injection to maintaining perfect cabin
temperature to controlling braking and suspension. These ECUs must be thoroughly tested
before releasing a new vehicle model to the market. 
The traditional testing method is to build an actual prototype car to do the tests. But this
incurs an enormous amount of money(about $200k-$300k for a car and need at least 200
units for testing), a lot of time, and effort. Therefore car manufacturers try to shift to the
digital realm with high-fidelity simulation models to reduce these high costs, time, and
setting up efforts. Some of the tools that are used for these types of testing are Synopsis
SILVER. and VDK. But these tools have three main problems. They are Expensive. They
are Slow (about 30x slower than real-time) and they are not compatible with simulation tools
such as MATLAB/SIMULINK. We try to address these problems in our project by
developing an ECU emulator. with high fidelity, fast instruction execution and make
compatibility with MATLAB/SIMULINK.
